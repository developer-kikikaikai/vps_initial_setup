## What is this?

Initialize setting support script for VPS.
This is running on DTI ServersMan Entry edition with CentOS simple plan.

So maybe it can be running on CentOS 7.

## 1st, to use this script

Please install git. And you have to update some package to clone code from github.
Then please do it by following commands:

```
yum --skip-broken -y update
yum -y install git
yum -y update  nss curl libcurl
git clone https://github.com/developer-kikikaikai/vps_initial_setup.git
```

## 2nd, after clone code

1. Please create your ssh-keypair by using ssh-keygen

```
 ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -f vps_ssh.pem
```

And overwrite vps_ssh.pem.pub in repos.

2. Call ./initialize.sh script
